Indexing Methods in the mongo Shell
Name                                                  Description
db.collection.createIndex()                           Builds an index on a collection.
db.collection.dropIndex()                             Removes a specified index on a collection.
db.collection.dropIndexes()                           Removes all indexes on a collection.
db.collection.getIndexes()                            Returns an array of documents that describe the existing indexes on a collection.
db.collection.reIndex()                               Rebuilds all existing indexes on a collection.
db.collection.totalIndexSize()                        Reports the total size used by the indexes on a collection. Provides a wrapper around the totalIndexSize field of the collStats output.
cursor.explain()                                      Reports on the query execution plan for a cursor.
cursor.hint()                                         Forces MongoDB to use a specific index for a query.
cursor.max()                                          Specifies an exclusive upper index bound for a cursor. For use with cursor.hint()
cursor.min()                                          Specifies an inclusive lower index bound for a cursor. For use with cursor.hint()

Indexing Database Commands
Name                                              Description
createIndexes                                     Builds one or more indexes for a collection.
dropIndexes                                       Removes indexes from a collection.
compact                                           Defragments a collection and rebuilds the indexes.
reIndex                                           Rebuilds all indexes on a collection.
validate                                          Internal command that scans for a collection's data and indexes for correctness.
geoSearch                                         Performs a geospatial query that uses MongoDB's haystack index functionality.
checkShardingIndex                                Internal command that validates index on shard key.
setIndexCommitQuorum                              Changes the minimum number of data-bearing members (i.e commit quorum), including the primary, that must vote to commit an in-progress index build before the primary marks those indexes as ready.

Geospatial Query Selectors地理空间查询选择器
Name                                       Description
$geoWithin                                 Selects geometries within a bounding GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $geoWithin.
$geoIntersects                             Selects geometries that intersect with a GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere index supports $geoIntersects.
$near                                      Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $near.
$nearSphere                                Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point on a sphere. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $nearSphere.

Indexing Query Modifiers索引查询修改器
Name                                      Description
$explain                                  Forces MongoDB to report on query execution plans. See explain().
$hint                                     Forces MongoDB to use a specific index. See hint()
$max                                      Specifies an exclusive upper limit for the index to use in a query. See max().
$min                                      Specifies an inclusive lower limit for the index to use in a query. See min().
$returnKey                                Forces the cursor to only return fields included in the index.
