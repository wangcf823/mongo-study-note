In sharded clusters, you can create zones of sharded data based on the shard key. You can associate each zone with one or more shards in the cluster. A shard can associate with any number of zones. In a balanced cluster, MongoDB migrates chunks covered by a zone only to those shards associated with the zone.
在分片集群中，您可以根据分片密钥创建分片数据的区域。您可以将每个区域与集群中的一个或多个分片关联。分片可以关联任意数量的区域。在平衡集群中，MongoDB仅将区域覆盖的块迁移到与该区域关联的分片中。

Some common deployment patterns where zones can be applied are as follows:
可以应用区域的一些常见部署模式如下：
Isolate a specific subset of data on a specific set of shards.
隔离特定分片集上的特定数据子集。
Ensure that the most relevant data reside on shards that are geographically closest to the application servers.
确保最相关的数据驻留在地理上最接近应用程序服务器的分片上。
Route data to shards based on the hardware / performance of the shard hardware.
根据分片硬件的硬件/性能将数据路由到分片。

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster with three shards and two zones. The A zone represents a range with a lower boundary of 1 and an upper bound of 10. The B zone represents a range with a lower boundary of 10 and an upper boundary of 20. Shards Alpha and Beta have the A zone. Shard Beta also has the B zone. Shard Charlie has no zones associated with it. The cluster is in a steady state and no chunks violate any of the zones.
下图说明了一个具有三个分片和两个区域的分片群集。A区表示下边界为1，上边界为10的范围。B区表示下边界为10，上边界为20的范围。碎片Alpha和Beta具有A区。Shard Beta也有B区。碎片查理没有与之关联的区域。群集处于稳定状态，没有任何块违反任何区域。
